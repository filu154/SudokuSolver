# SudokuSolver

How to use the solver:

1. Run main.py
2. It will open a window with an already existing sudoku. You can either press on an empty cell and then add a number to it, or press on a cell with a
   number to change/remove it. When you are satisfied with the input, press start and watch it solve the sudoku!

# Features that will be added in case you want to check out the project again in a couple of weeks:
  1. Pause button
  2. Save button to save a sudoku that you give as input

Not a really big or spectacular project but I hope you will have fun with it!
